## General Review  

First of all, the code looks great and simple. You seem to be following best practices!  

However, here are some basic notes to help with scaling the project:

- **You can add a `requirements.txt` file** to make it easier to reinstall dependencies later.
- **You can add a `.gitignore` file** to improve version control by ignoring unnecessary files.

The rest of the notes will be added directly to the code in the PR.
